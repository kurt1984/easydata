    "text": "Orchestration and scheduling\n\nApache Airflow\nApache Airflow is the current standard tool for complex workflow orchestration. Although Airflow and dbt share some similarities, dbt is for transformation step, Airflow is the job scheduler for the whole project. It is difficult to grasp such one tool, let alone make both tools work together. Thanks to Cosmos by Astronomer, now it is much easier to setup and make Airflow and dbt work together more harmoniously.\nPreviously, the common way to use both tools, is just run a airflow bashoperator for dbt. It is not ideal, since it is difficult to see the DAG inside dbt. Now with Cosmo, one can monitor the whole process including the dbt DAG inside Airflow, as the screenshot for this project shown below.\n\n\n\nDagster\nDagster is another popular data pipeline orchestration tool. It is uniquely fit for data pipeline workflow, since it is based on the notion of asset driven workflow. Any upstream asset modification will automatically notify the downstreams. Unlike Airflow, even the latest data-aware scheduling feature of Airflow, cannot detect dataset changes themselves.\nAnother benefit of using Daster is its lightweight design. Only one node is needed, as comparing to Airflow, which requires four nodes (webserver, scheduler, trigerer, database)\nLatest development of Dagster, make it possible to have full observability across pipelines including what’s inside dbt, thanks to dagster-dbt"
