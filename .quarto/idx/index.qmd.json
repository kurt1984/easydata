To have a good understanding, I went over following resources:\n\n- [The Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/)\n- [OHDSI - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@OHDSI)\n- [Data Standardization – OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/)\n\n## Data Visualization Application\n\nAn interactive data visualization app using plotly is developped.

Although Airflow and dbt share some similarities, dbt is for transformation step, Airflow is the job scheduler for the whole project. It is difficult to grasp such one tool, let alone make both tools work together. Thanks to [Cosmos by Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/cosmos/), now it is much easier to setup and make Airflow and dbt work together more harmoniously.\n\nPreviously, the common way to use both tools, is just run a airflow bashoperator for dbt. It is not ideal, since it is difficult to see the DAG inside dbt. Now with Cosmo, one can monitor the whole process including the dbt DAG inside Airflow, as the screenshot for this project shown below.\n\n![](airflow_screenshot.png)\n\n### Dagster\n\n[Dagster](https://dagster.io/) is another popular data pipeline orchestration tool. It is uniquely fit for data pipeline workflow, since it is based on the notion of asset driven workfow. Any upstream asset modification will automatically notify the downstreams. Unlike Airflow, even the latest Data-aware scheduling feature of Airflow, cannot detect dataset changes themselves. \n\nAnother benefit of using Daster is its lightweight design. Only one node is needed, as comparing to Airflow, which requires four nodes (webserver, scheduler, trigerer, database)\n\nLatest development of Dagster, make it possible to have full observability across pipelines including what's inside dbt, thanks to [dagster-dbt](https://docs.dagster.io/_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt)\n\n![](dagster_screenshot.png)\n\n## Summary\n\nThis is a . The main purpose of this project is to showcasing the knowledge and skills involved in producing a tailor-made and well-managed workflow using state of the art healthcare data solutions.\n\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nTL;DR You can find the project code on \n\n\n- [Airflow app](https://github.com/kurt1984/ELT_OMOP_Airflow)\n- [Dagster app](https://github.com/kurt1984/ELT_OMOP_Dagster)\n\nshowcasing:\n\n- Full functional real world ELT data pipeline to data science app orchestration with full observability (whole pipeline including DAGs inside dbt)\n- Realistic healthcare data engineering workflow (Synthea to OMOP-CDM)\n- Options to choose job orchestration tools between Apache Airflow and Dagster\n\nThis is Lei's working portfolio project, illustrating a realistic data pipeline implemented from extracting electronic medical records (EMR), various medical vocabularies, loading onto a database,  transforming data using dbt and further conducting an interactive data science report. while the workflow is orchestrated, scheduled and monitored with full oberverability using Apache airflow or Dagster.\n\n\nThe pipeline process is documented using diagram as code tool [Diagrams](https://diagrams.mingrammer.com/)\n\n```{python}\nimport ssl\nssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context\n\nfrom diagrams import Diagram, Cluster\nfrom diagrams.custom import Custom\nfrom urllib.request import urlretrieve\n\nfrom diagrams.onprem.analytics import Dbt\nfrom diagrams.onprem.database import Postgresql\nfrom diagrams.onprem.workflow import Airflow\nfrom diagrams.generic.storage import Storage\nfrom diagrams.programming.language import Python\n\nwith Diagram(\"Synthea OMOP CDM ELT Workflow\", show=False) as diag:\n\n    # download the icon image file\n    dagster_url = \"https://dagster.io/images/brand/logos/dagster-primary-mark.png\"\n    dagster_icon = \"dagster-primary-mark.png\"\n    urlretrieve(dagster_url, dagster_icon)\n\n    with Cluster(\"Orchestration & Scheduler\", direction=\"LR\"):    \n        orchestrator = [Airflow('Apache Airflow'),Custom(\"Dagster\", dagster_icon)]\n\n    with Cluster(\"Data Pipeline\"):\n        dbt = Dbt(\"dbt\") \n        postgres = Postgresql(\"Postgres\")\n        storage = [Storage(\"Synthea \"), Storage(\"Athena Vocab\")] \n        storage >> postgres >> dbt\n\n    with Cluster(\"Data Science App\"):\n\n        python = Python(\"Python\")\n\n        plotly_url = \"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8a/Plotly-logo.png\"\n        plotly_icon = \"Plotly-logo.png\"\n        urlretrieve(plotly_url, plotly_icon)\n\n        plotly = Custom(\"Plotly\", plotly_icon)\n        python >> plotly\n\n\n    orchestrator >> dbt\n    orchestrator >> postgres\n    orchestrator >> python\ndiag\n```\n\n\n\n## Extraction process\n\nOpen sourced [Synthea](https://synthea.mitre.org/) project provides the capability of generating realistic synthetic EMR data, and downloadable data in various formats.
