The csv files has been used in this project.\n\n[Athena](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/start) is one of the open sourced tools provided by [OHDSI – Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics](https://www.ohdsi.org/), greatly simplied the process of converting various medical codes to standard codes. For this project, I downloaded a subset of the codes listed on the website.\n\nGreat Expectations were used for data quality checks. For illustration purpose, the Id in the patients csv file were checked for existence of null value.\n\n## Loading process\n\nBoth sets of datasets (csv format) were loaded to duckDB, orchestrated by workflow scheduler (Apache Airflow or Dagster). \n\n## Transformation process\n\ndbt were used for the whole transformation process. It is currently the stands for the T step in ETL/ELT process.\n\nThe sql codes were adopted from [ETL-Synthea-dbt](https://github.com/sidataplus/ETL-Synthea-dbt/tree/dcb9c262bad32e5d04cd73e4f34a01d884f3e71c) which in turn were adopted from OHDSI tool [OHDSI/ETL-Synthea](https://github.com/OHDSI/ETL-Synthea).\n\ndbt tests were used for each dbt models, as an example for data quality control.\n\nThis process is complex in nature. To have a good understanding, I went over following resources:\n\n- [The Book of OHDSI](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/)\n- [OHDSI - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@OHDSI)\n- [Data Standardization – OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/data-standardization/)\n\n## Data Visualization Application\n\nA BI Dashboard tool Metabase is connected to the database for interactive data visualization.\n![](metabase_screenshot.png)\n\nAn interactive data visualization app using plotly is developped. The rendering is triggered by orchestrator (Airflow or Dagster) after the data pipeline has been sucsessfully completed. \n\nFor demonstration purpose, a histogram of year of birth is plotted using OMOP-CDM patient dataset.\n\n![](plotly_screenshot.png)\n\n## Orchestration and scheduling\n\n### Apache Airflow\n\nApache Airflow is the current standard tool for complex workflow orchestration. Although Airflow and dbt share some similarities, dbt is for transformation step, Airflow is the job scheduler for the whole project. It is difficult to grasp such one tool, let alone make both tools work together. Thanks to [Cosmos by Astronomer](https://www.astronomer.io/cosmos/), now it is much easier to setup and make Airflow and dbt work together more harmoniously.\n\nPreviously, the common way to use both tools, is just run a airflow bashoperator for dbt. It is not ideal, since it is difficult to see the DAG inside dbt. Now with Cosmo, one can monitor the whole process including the dbt DAG inside Airflow, as the screenshot for this project shown below.\n\n![](airflow_screenshot.png)\n\n### Dagster\n\n[Dagster](https://dagster.io/) is another popular data pipeline orchestration tool. It is uniquely fit for data pipeline workflow, since it is based on the notion of asset driven workflow. Any upstream asset modification will automatically notify the downstreams. Unlike Airflow, even the latest data-aware scheduling feature of Airflow, cannot detect dataset changes themselves. \n\nAnother benefit of using Daster is its lightweight design. Only one node is needed, as comparing to Airflow, which requires four nodes (webserver, scheduler, trigerer, database)\n\nLatest development of Dagster, make it possible to have full observability across pipelines including what's inside dbt, thanks to [dagster-dbt](https://docs.dagster.io/_apidocs/libraries/dagster-dbt)\n\n![](dagster_screenshot.png)\n\n## Summary\n\nThe main purpose of this project is to showcasing the knowledge and skills involved in producing a tailor-made and well-managed workflow using state of the art healthcare data solutions.\n\n",
